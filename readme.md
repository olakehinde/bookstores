My Bookstores project.
======================
We setup a virtual development environmengt using vagrant for provisionning our LEMP stack.
The tools we're developing with are as follows:

1.	Linux (ola/lampstack)
2.	Php7.0
3.	MySQL
4.	Nginx
5.	phpmyadmin

Ensure that you use a virtual box as your provider

Enjoy!!!
